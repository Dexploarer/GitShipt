# GitBags — agent context

You are working in **GitBags**, a Solana token launchpad that pays out trading fees to a GitHub repo's top contributors daily. Read these two files first; they bind every decision:

1. **`DESIGN.md`** — Google Labs DESIGN.md spec defining the cypherpunk-dark visual system. Two palettes (dark canonical + light mirror).
2. **`gitbags-prd.md`** — full product spec: architecture, data model, Bags integration, security model, page tree, permissions matrix.

If anything in these files conflicts with your training data, the file wins.

## Stack pins (verified April 2026)

- **Runtime**: Bun workspace monorepo, Next.js 16.2 (App Router, Server Actions, Turbopack, React Compiler), React 19.2, Node 22.
- **DB**: Neon Postgres via `drizzle-orm/neon-http` for workflow steps; `neon-serverless` for multi-statement transactions. Non-Neon `DATABASE_URL`s (Supabase pooler, local Postgres) fall back to `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` — RLS context wrapping is Neon-only, so non-Neon paths rely on `requirePermission` for authorization.
- **Cache / nonces / rate-limit**: Upstash Redis.
- **Background**: Vercel Workflows (`workflow` package, `'use workflow'` / `'use step'` directives). **Step idempotency is NOT automatic** — pass `getStepMetadata().stepId` as the key for any external API call.
- **Auth**: `better-auth` with GitHub OAuth + custom SIWS plugin (`@phantom/sign-in-with-solana`).
- **Solana**: `@solana/web3.js@^1.98.x` (v1 line; do not use `@solana/kit`).
- **Bags**: `@bagsfm/bags-sdk` Token Launch v2. Claim namespace is `sdk.fee.*` (not `sdk.feeClaim.*`).
- **UI**: Tailwind v4 (`@theme inline`, no `tailwind.config.js`) + `@repo/ui` shadcn-style primitives + Lucide + Geist / Geist Mono.
- **Theming**: `next-themes` with `attribute="data-theme"`, `defaultTheme="system"`, `disableTransitionOnChange`, `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`.

## Authoring rules

- **No raw hex in components.** Ever. Use design tokens via Tailwind utilities: `bg-surface`, `text-fg`, `text-fg-secondary`, `border-border-strong`, `text-rank-gold`. Both palettes resolve automatically.
- **Mono for money.** Every SOL amount, USD price, score, BPS value, timestamp, and tx signature uses `text-mono-md` or `text-mono-sm`. Body copy is never mono.
- **One primary per viewport.** Stacking primary-green buttons + green sparklines + green pills in the same fold is the most common drift. Pick one.
- **Components never call `useTheme()`** except `theme-toggle.tsx`. Theming is automatic via CSS variables.
- **`proxy.ts` is redirects only.** Auth must be revalidated inside every protected route handler and Server Component (CVE-2025-29927 mitigation).
- **TypeScript strict.** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on. No `any` outside justified, commented type holes.
- **Every Server Action and route that mutates state** must (a) revalidate the session, (b) check permissions via `requirePermission`, (c) write an audit log entry on success, (d) accept and respect `Idempotency-Key`.
- **External API responses are Zod-validated.** Never trust shape from Bags, GitHub, or Helius.
- **Sensitive env vars** (`*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*KEYPAIR`) must be flagged Sensitive in Vercel (post-April-2026 incident). Cold treasury keys never enter Vercel.

## File-tree quick map

- `apps/web/app/` — App Router. `(public)`, `(auth)`, `dashboard/` (project owner), `admin/` (super-admin, separate session realm).
- `apps/web/workflows/` — Vercel Workflows. One file per workflow. `steps/` for shared step helpers.
- `apps/web/components/` — app-owned chrome/features: public shell, sidebar, launch wizard, admin, wallet, shared app components.
- `apps/web/lib/` — `auth/` (better-auth + SIWS + permissions), `bags/` (typed client, stub-flippable), `github/` (Octokit App), `solana/`, `scoring/`, `redis.ts`, `rate-limit.ts`, `idempotency.ts`, `audit.ts`.
- `apps/web/db/` — Drizzle: `schema/` (one file per concern), `migrations/`, `index.ts` (exports `dbHttp` + `dbPool`).
- `packages/ui/` — shared UI primitive barrel imported as `@repo/ui`.
- `packages/lib/` — pure utility barrel imported as `@repo/lib`.
- `packages/shared/` — Zod schemas, types, constants reused on client + server, imported as `@repo/shared`.
- `apps/web/proxy.ts` — Next 16 file (renamed from `middleware.ts`). Redirects only.

## Day-1 status (April 25, 2026)

Foundation in progress: scaffold + design system + DB schema + auth shells + first workflow. See plan at `~/.claude/plans/you-are-building-gitbags-moonlit-wand.md`.

## When you hit a credential blocker

Stop and tell the user exactly what env var you need in one sentence. Do not invent secrets. External clients (`apps/web/lib/bags/`, `apps/web/lib/solana/`, `apps/web/lib/github/`) ship with stub fallbacks — flipping to live is one env-presence check per service.
